        <h2>Chat Bot with database</h2>
        <p>I developed a chatbot utilizing the ChatGPT API, which allows users to engage in natural language conversations. The chatbot is seamlessly integrated with a database to store chat history, enabling users to revisit previous interactions. The chatbot can provide informative responses while keeping track of user inputs and bot replies, creating a cohesive conversational flow.</p>
