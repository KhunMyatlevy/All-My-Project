        <h2>Self-Made vs. Inherited Wealth Analysis</h2>
        <p>In this project, I analyzed the distribution of self-made versus inherited wealth among billionaires. Using interactive charts, I visualized key differences in age, industries, and geographic locations. The analysis revealed notable trends, such as the dominance of self-made billionaires in technology and finance. This project provided a clear, data-driven view of wealth creation patterns across demographics.</p>
